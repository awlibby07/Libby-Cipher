This is not a key finder

Will not properly decode phrases that were encoded with the wrong key

R1 can only use capitals, spaces, and lowercases

If more than 1 space is used in between words, the wrong encoded / decoded phrase will be displayed

feel free to copy and past my code, just make sure to give some credits to me
